 one testimonial text from larita williams :
**Name:** LaRita Williams (LW)

**Q: What was your situation before joining the program, and what challenges were you facing?**
*A: Before joining DIM, I was a former classroom teacher and partnership director for an education nonprofit. I had recently been laid off and was using the transition time to self-teach in SQL, Python, and Tableau but needed feedback and guidance on my work as well as support and direction for my resume and technical interview skills.*

**Q: What made you decide to join, and what stood out to you about this program compared to others?**
*A: What stood out to me and set this program above others was definitely the people! Kedeisha took the time to meet me and understand my background, needs, and goals. She jumped in and started answering my questions and sharing advice right away. I could tell she was knowledgeable and believed in me like no other mentor I'd tried to find previously.*

**Q: What specific results or wins have you achieved since joining?**
*A: About three months into the program, I had new projects for my portfolio, a resume and LinkedIn that I was proud of, dozens of successful job interviews, and five data analyst job offers! Not to mention newfound confidence and ability in my tech stack.*

**Q: What has been your favorite part of the program, and why?**
*A: My favorite part of the program is detailed and hands-on support. The DIM team was there to support me every step of the way for any question big or small and at pretty much any time of day. I also really appreciate the network of other analysts that I've met and developed with.*

**Q: Who would you recommend this program to, and why?**
*A: I would recommend this program to career changers, those just starting out in data, or those wanting a source for hands-on review and practice; to anyone who feels like they "get it" but aren't sure what to do with it or what to do next; and to those who are serious about their data analyst journey!*
