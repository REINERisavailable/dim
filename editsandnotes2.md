 9-remove this part 'What was your situation before joining?
Before joining DIM, I was a former classroom teacher and partnership director for an education nonprofit. I had recently been laid off and was using the transition time to self-teach in SQL, Python, and Tableau but needed feedback and guidance.

What made you decide to join?
What stood out to me was definitely the people! Kedeisha took the time to meet me and understand my background, needs, and goals. She jumped in and started answering my questions and sharing advice right away.

What results have you achieved?
About three months into the program, I had new projects for my portfolio, a resume and LinkedIn that I was proud of, dozens of successful job interviews, and five data analyst job offers! Not to mention newfound confidence and ability in my tech stack.

What's your favorite part of the program?
My favorite part is the detailed and hands-on support. The DIM team was there to support me every step of the way for any question big or small and at pretty much any time of day.' and restrucute all videos well bcs some 16 by 9 some are not
